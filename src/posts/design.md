So going with this bare metal approach, I have no real starting point for the design. So off to the google machine for inspiration. I want something really simple to start with, just a header, some links and a layout for posts.
 
## Css framework
Just to get a baseline, it's always nice to start with some sort of css framework. But let's not go all bootstrap crazy right away, [skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/) should be enough.
 
For now, we'll just put all the links in the top, and then wrap the content in a container. Maybe a 2 column layout on larger screens, with a sidebar with useful stuff.
